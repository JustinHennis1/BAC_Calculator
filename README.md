# BAC CALCULATOR (using Widmarks's Equation)
## Calculates the number of standard drinks
## Categorizes Drinkers based on the number of drinks they had. Light/Moderate/Heavy
## Calculates BAC by taking the alchohol consumption in grams D and dividing 
that by body weight W in grams multiplied by the constant distribution ratio 
according to gender RM/RF. All of that is then subtracted by L which is a metabolism
constant designated to each type of drinker multiplied by the time elapsed H. Finally 
multiply by 100 to get the Final BAC Score.
